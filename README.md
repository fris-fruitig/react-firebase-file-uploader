# react-firebase-file-uploader
A file uploader for react that uploads images, videos and other files to your firebase storage.

## Props

  * `storageRef` (required) - A reference to the firebase storage folder, where the file should be saved.
  * `onUploadStart` - A callback function that is called with the selected file as its only argument.
  * `onProgress` - A callback function that is called with the progress (between 0 and 100) as its only argument.
  * `onUploadSuccess` - A callback function that is called with the filename of the uploaded file.
  * `onUploadError` - A callback function that is called with a [Firebase error](https://firebase.google.com/docs/storage/web/handle-errors) in case of an error during the upload process.
  * `filename` - The name you would like to give to the file. This can either be a function or a string. If a function is provided, it will be called with the selected file as its first and only argument. If no value is provided, it will use the filename of the file itself or a random generated name if `randomizeFilename` is set to true.
  * `metadata` - An object with the metadata that should be added to the file. You can use this for example to configure caching for your file with `metadata={{cacheControl: 'max-age=3600'}}`.
  * `randomizeFilename` - If true, generates a random filename for your file.
  * `as` - The component you provide in this prop will be rendered instead of the standard html `input`.
  * `maxHeight` - The maximum height of in case an image is provided, please see below for more explanation.
  * `maxWidth` - The maximum width in case a image is provided.
    The image will be scaled down, such that the image is contained in the maxWidth/maxHeight region.
    The resulting image will be centered and the parts that stick out will be cropped off.
  * Default props of a html `input` such as `accept`, `disabled`, `form`, `formNoValidate`, `name`, `readOnly`, `required`, `value`

## Prerequisites
Make sure you have initialized firebase somewhere in your app using:

``` javascript
import firebase from 'firebase';

const config = {
  apiKey: "<API_KEY>",
  authDomain: "<PROJECT_ID>.firebaseapp.com",
  databaseURL: "https://<DATABASE_NAME>.firebaseio.com",
  storageBucket: "<BUCKET>.appspot.com",
};
firebase.initializeApp(config);
```

## Example

``` javascript
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import firebase from 'firebase';
import FileUploader from 'react-firebase-file-uploader';

class ProfilePage extends Component {
  state = {
    username: '',
    avatar: '',
    isUploading: false,
    progress: 0,
    avatarURL: ''
  };

  handleChangeUsername = (event) => this.setState({username: event.target.value});
  handleUploadStart = () => this.setState({isUploading: true, progress: 0});
  handleProgress = (progress) => this.setState({progress});
  handleUploadError = (error) => {
    this.setState({isUploading: false});
    console.error(error);
  }
  handleUploadSuccess = (filename) => {
    this.setState({avatar: filename, progress: 100, isUploading: false});
    firebase.storage().ref('images').child(filename).getDownloadURL().then(url => this.setState({avatarURL: url}));
  };

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <form>
          <label>Username:</label>
          <input type="text" value={this.state.username} name="username" onChange={this.handleChangeUsername} />
          <label>Avatar:</label>
          {this.state.isUploading &&
            <p>Progress: {this.state.progress}</p>
          }
          {this.state.avatarURL &&
            <img src={this.state.avatarURL} />
          }
          <FileUploader
            accept="image/*"
            name="avatar"
            randomizeFilename
            storageRef={firebase.storage().ref('images')}
            onUploadStart={this.handleUploadStart}
            onUploadError={this.handleUploadError}
            onUploadSuccess={this.handleUploadSuccess}
            onProgress={this.handleProgress}
          />
        </form>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default ProfilePage;
```

### Generate a filename
If you would like to generate a filename yourself you can provide a function as `filename` attribute:

``` javascript
...
  <FileUploader
    accept="image/*"
    name="avatar"
    filename={file => this.state.username + file.name.split('.')[1]; }
    storageRef={firebase.storage().ref('images')}
    onUploadStart={this.handleUploadStart}
    onUploadError={this.handleUploadError}
    onUploadSuccess={this.handleUploadSuccess}
    onProgress={this.handleProgress}
  />
...
```

In the example above, the filename is generated by is naively (do not use in production!) extracting the file extension from the selected file and placing it after the username, such that the resulting filename will be `johndoe.jpg` if the username were `johndoe` and the extension of the selected file `.jpg`.
